<h2>Individual Contribution:</h2>

My main contribution to the website was designing the dropdown menu, the home page and the footer. I made an attempt to edit the about page but soon found out that it also edited other pages as well so i decided to leave it to the people designing those pages so that there were no conflicts in the file. I also did some work towards the end of the project to introduce responsive design as best I could

I found not having complete control over the content one of the biggest problems for me. However as I understood the website and its structure I understood it more, but it also got more overwhelming. Trying to learn Tailwind css as a part of this assignment made it a bit more difficult in the beginning but as I understood how it worked, I was able to work better and more confidently. Being unable to do some of our desired features (as shown in the figma document) was something I realised a bit too late, so some time was wasted on things did not end up in the website

<h2>Issue Resolution:</h2>

We came across a few issues with this project like styles not applying when and where we want them, and overwritting other peoples work.

We discovered mid-way through that multiple pages read from the same template file, which meant that they had to be styled similarly and a few of us were trying to edit it at the same time which led to some conflicts. 
A common issue we would have was we would also fetch and commit to main, which meant that sometimes peoples progress was erased because it was overridden by someone else’ commit changes. Ryan then suggested that we should actually push and commit to our own branch and then in the end we merge the branches in the end.

A big issue right at the end of the project was when we were merging eachothers branches. I organised a call between our group so we could talk about and fix the problems that might occur when we merge. A mistake we made was we tried to merge everyone's branches at once which meant we had some issues occur with a couple of the pages styles disappearing or changing. Ryan offered to do the rest of the merging. He had the most experience using github so we thought that would be best.

<h2>Team Collaboration:</h2>

In the beginning we did design research on websites we would take some inspiration from. From those websites, We took those ideas and website snapshots and put them into a figma document which contained; font, navigation, style and content layout.

For team collaboration, after the research, Max created a spreadsheet to make sure that the group knew who was working on what and so that people weren’t working on the same pages. This became complicated when we figured out that a lot of the pages used similar files but it worked for the most part. When the area of the website was completed, we would simply move onto another area that needed doing. There wasn’t any hardcore division of tasks.
