Individual Contribution:
Throughout this assessment, I managed various pages, including events, news, videos, articles, links, and their associated subpages. Additionally, I contributed to shaping pages such as supporters, about, and partners, considering the significant overlap in file formatting. This being said due to the mentioned overlapping, a lot of the pages were worked on by multiple members of our group.

In addition to the pages I was responsible for overseeing, I was able to leverage my professional experience, taking charge of our GitHub. Ensuring seamless merging of branches to prevent data loss or conflicts.

Coming from a website development background, much of the learning from this task was qualitative, particularly through collaboration with design students. I had the chance to enhance my UX design skills by learning from their expertise. Furthermore, this project allowed me to broaden my knowledge into Tailwind and WordPress, both of which were previously unexplored territories for me.


Issue Resolution:
Our primary challenge revolved around the website's layout and design, where alterations to individual pages often triggered unintended changes across others. This predicament frequently resulted in inadvertently overwriting others' contributions or necessitated compromises in design choices to maintain consistency across various pages. Consequently, we recognized the necessity of enhancing our GitHub processes by incorporating branching. Constantly committing to the main branch led to extensive rewriting and redoing of work, as we frequently had to backtrack to undo and implement changes.


Team Collaboration:
The team's collaboration, communication, and task distribution were commendable, albeit challenging to balance due to uncertainties and varying levels of proficiency. Nonetheless, everyone made valuable contributions, communication was robust, and collaboration exceeded expectations in ensuring a cohesive theme throughout the website.
