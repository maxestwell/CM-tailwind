<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Canberra is a young city with a rich architectural legacy. With major boom periods in the 1920s and again from the 1950s-1980s – the architectural aesthetic of the city is eclectic, but deliberately cohesive. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The mid-late twentieth century period of development in Canberra, specifically during the National Capital Development Commission’s (NCDC) oversight (1958-1989) has not been widely celebrated or recognised by the Canberra community.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Major developments not only in residential, but civic and community buildings saw the frequent involvement of architects now considered pioneers of the modernist movement, and the construction of a key collection of iconic and unique mid-century buildings in Australia. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Many of these structures, which make an irreplaceable contribution to Canberra, have already been lost and many face risk of being lost in the near future. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So we at Canberra Modern are here to help by engaging Canberra and Australia with their contemporary National Capital.&nbsp;</p>
